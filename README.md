This project was started by Will Clark and Geoff Spielman at the Waterloo EngHack on June 25, 2016.
We have continued working on it and completed it in August, 2016.

The system uses an iPhone App, Node.js Server, Raspberry Pi and Arduino to allow users to play a memory game between a phone and a circuit on a breadboard. Users can also send messages back and forth using Morse code on the breadboard side and text on the iPhone.
